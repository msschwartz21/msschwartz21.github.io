Little is known about the cells at the midline that facilitate this tightly regulated process. We exploit the con served process of vertebrate embryonic development in the zebrafish model system to elucidate the identity of cells at the midline that may facilitate postoptic (POC) and anterior commissure (AC) development. We have discovered that three differentgfap+ astroglial cell morphologies persist in contact with pathfinding axons throughout commissure formation. Similarly, olig2+ progenitor cells occupy delineated portions of the postoptic and anterior commissures. These early olig2+ progenitors demonstrate glial-like morphologies despite the lack of a myelination marker. Moreover, we conclude that both the gfap+ and olig2+progenitor cells give rise to neuronal populations in both the telencephalon and diencephalon. Interestingly, these varied cell populations showed significant developmental heterochrony between the telencephalon and diencephalon. Lastly, we also showed that fli1a+ mesenchymal cells migrate along the presumptive commissure regions before and during midline axon crossing. Furthermore, following commissure maturation, specific blood vessels formed at the midline of the POC and immediately ventral and parallel to the AC. This comprehensive account of the cellular populations that correlate with the timing and position of commissural axon pathfinding has supported the conceptual modeling and identification of the early forebrain architecture that may be necessary for proper commissure development.","tags":null,"title":"Characterizing the diverse cells that associate with the developing commissures of the zebrafish forebrain","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M Schwartz","J Schnabl","MPH Litz","B Baumer","MJ Barresi"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1597340394,"objectID":"92e5cb9e8d4674bb956572ba58ac6fa6","permalink":"/publication/schwartz-2020-deltascope/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/schwartz-2020-deltascope/","section":"publication","summary":"Research in the life sciences has traditionally relied on the analysis of clear morphological phenotypes, which are often revealed using increasingly powerful microscopy techniques analyzed as maximum intensity projections (MIPs). However, as biology turns towards the analysis of more subtle phenotypes, MIPs and qualitative approaches are failing to adequately describe these phenotypes. To address these limitations and quantitatively analyze the three-dimensional (3D) spatial relationships of biological structures, we developed the computational method and program called ΔSCOPE (Changes in Spatial Cylindrical Coordinate Orientation using PCA Examination). Our approach uses the fluorescent signal distribution within a 3D data set and reorients the fluorescent signal to a relative biological reference structure. This approach enables quantification and statistical analysis of spatial relationships and signal density in 3D multichannel signals that are positioned around a well-defined structure contained in a reference channel. We validated the application of ΔSCOPE by analyzing normal axon and glial cell guidance in the zebrafish forebrain and by quantifying the commissural phenotypes associated with abnormal Slit guidance cue expression in the forebrain. Despite commissural phenotypes which display disruptions to the reference structure, ΔSCOPE was able to detect subtle, previously uncharacterized changes in zebrafish forebrain midline crossing axons and glia. This method has been developed as a user-friendly, open source program. We propose that ΔSCOPE is an innovative approach to advancing the state of image quantification in the field of high resolution microscopy, and that the techniques presented here are of broad applications to the life science field.","tags":null,"title":"ΔSCOPE: A new method to quantify 3D biological structures and identify differences in zebrafish forebrain development","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1573603200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1597639313,"objectID":"3229d7d8d00217b33864db4aa3967909","permalink":"/talk/janelia-2019-talk/","publishdate":"2019-11-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/janelia-2019-talk/","section":"talk","summary":"Women in Computational Biology","tags":["presentation"],"title":"Deep learning enabled image analysis unites high throughput functional genomics with live cell imaging","type":"talk"},{"authors":["E Moen","E Borba","G Miller","M Schwartz","D Bannon","N Koe","I Camplisson","D Kyme","C Pavelcheck","T Price","T Kudo","E Pao","W Graf","D Van Valen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1570147200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1597340394,"objectID":"4770cd7ed7b766355c16544169f7cb35","permalink":"/publication/moen-2019-tracking/","publishdate":"2019-10-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/moen-2019-tracking/","section":"publication","summary":"Live-cell imaging experiments have opened an exciting window into the behavior of living systems. While these experiments can produce rich data, the computational analysis of these datasets is challenging. Single-cell analysis requires that cells be accurately identified in each image and subsequently tracked over time. Increasingly, deep learning is being used to interpret microscopy image with single cell resolution. In this work, we apply deep learning to the problem of tracking single cells in live-cell imaging data. Using crowdsourcing and a human-in-the-loop approach to data annotation, we constructed a dataset of over 11,000 trajectories of cell nuclei that includes lineage information. Using this dataset, we successfully trained a deep learning model to perform cell tracking within a linear programming framework. Benchmarking tests demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the task of cell tracking with respect to multiple accuracy metrics. Further, we show that our deep learning-based method generalizes to perform cell tracking for both fluorescent and brightfield images of the cell cytoplasm, despite having never been trained on those data types. This enables analysis of live-cell imaging data collected across imaging modalities. A persistent cloud deployment of our cell tracker is available at http://www.deepcell.org.","tags":null,"title":"Accurate cell tracking and lineage construction in live-cell imaging experiments with deep learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["D Bannon","E Moen","M Schwartz","E Borba","S Cui","K Huang","I Camplisson","N Koe","D Kyme","T Kudo","B Chang","E Pao","E Osterman","W Graf","D Van Valen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1568505600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1597340394,"objectID":"f13b61c293a6c8421f8bae906e0708df","permalink":"/publication/bannon-2019-kiosk/","publishdate":"2019-09-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/bannon-2019-kiosk/","section":"publication","summary":"Deep learning is transforming the ability of life scientists to extract information from images. These techniques have better accuracy than conventional approaches and enable previously impossible analyses. As the capability of deep learning methods expands, they are increasingly being applied to large imaging datasets. The computational demands of deep learning present a significant barrier to large-scale image analysis. To meet this challenge, we have developed DeepCell 2.0, a platform for deploying deep learning models on large imaging datasets (105-megapixel images) in the cloud. This software enables the turnkey deployment of a Kubernetes cluster on all commonly used operating systems. By using a microservice architecture, our platform matches computational operations with their hardware requirements to reduce operating costs. Further, it scales computational resources to meet demand, drastically reducing the time necessary for analysis of large datasets. A thorough analysis of costs demonstrates that cloud computing is economically competitive for this application. By treating hardware infrastructure as software, this work foreshadows a new generation of software packages for biology in which computational resources are a dynamically allocated resource.","tags":null,"title":"Dynamic allocation of computational resources for deep learning-enabled cellular image analysis with Kubernetes","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1522540800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1597639313,"objectID":"92a44e0c0da90a4d8a78dd12d09e75ef","permalink":"/poster/deltascope-2018-poster/","publishdate":"2018-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/poster/deltascope-2018-poster/","section":"poster","summary":"New England Society for Developmental Biology, *Awarded First Place Undergraduate Poster*","tags":["posters"],"title":"ΔSCOPE: A new method to quantify biological structures and identify differences in zebrafish forebrain development","type":"poster"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1498867200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1597639313,"objectID":"ec44f4f1232f9855f87ab3f15ac025dd","permalink":"/poster/deltascope-2017-poster/","publishdate":"2017-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/poster/deltascope-2017-poster/","section":"poster","summary":"National Society for Developmental Biology, *Awarded First Place Undergraduate Poster*","tags":["posters"],"title":"A new computational method to quantify 3D image data to detail changes in morphological structure and spatial relationships during nervous system development","type":"poster"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1475280000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1597639313,"objectID":"48ffe3add944805e7a03f9516bf827a1","permalink":"/talk/janelia-2016-talk/","publishdate":"2016-10-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/janelia-2016-talk/","section":"talk","summary":"Women in the World","tags":["presentation"],"title":"Untangling brain development at Janelia Research Campus.","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1459468800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1597639313,"objectID":"27d6b92849859121b570ba83d31d66c9","permalink":"/poster/robo4-2016-poster/","publishdate":"2016-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/poster/robo4-2016-poster/","section":"poster","summary":"New England Society for Developmental Biology, *Awarded First Place Undergraduate Poster*","tags":["posters"],"title":"Investigating the role of robo4 in glial bridge condensation and its influence on the formation of the post-optic commissure","type":"poster"},{"authors":["M Schwartz","T Beach","A Tsai","M Malek-Ahmadi","S Jacobson","LI Sue","K Davis","M Sabbagh","G Serrano"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1452902400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1597340394,"objectID":"f3d2cf7ececa9880b61ccd3320b0fc7d","permalink":"/publication/schwartz-2016-dementia/","publishdate":"2016-01-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/schwartz-2016-dementia/","section":"publication","summary":"Objective: The aim of this study is to contribute to an understanding of the clinical presentation and pathological features of neurofibrillary tangle predominant dementia (NFTPD) that will assist with the eventual development of methods for its ante-mortem identification. Method: We contrast eight NFTPD cases identified in the Banner Sun Health Research Institute Brain and Body Donation Program (SHRI-BBDP) database to 114 Alzheimer’s disease (AD) subjects, in terms of their demographics, clinical features, and pathological features. Results: When NFTPD subjects were compared to AD subjects, they were found to have a later onset of symptoms, an older age at death, less impairment prior to death, and less frequent appearance of the Apolipoprotein E ε4 variant. None of the eight NFTPD subjects met the clinical criteria for probable AD. They possessed a diverse range of diagnoses including possible AD, mixed vascular dementia (VAD), dementia NOS, and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). AD-related pathology, for both amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, was less severe in NFTPD subjects than in AD subjects. All eight NFTPD subjects were classified as neurofibrillary tangle Braak stage IV and therefore had fewer tangles in the neocortex when compared to AD subjects with mean Braak stage V (range II–VI). Conclusion: NFTPD subjects have dementia despite a lower pathological burden when compared to AD subjects. In this small sample, the ante-mortem presentation is such that NFTPD subjects are not diagnosed with probable AD. The cognitive and non-cognitive clinical features (delusions, depression, parkinsonism, and hallucinations) of NFTPD and AD are very similar and do not serve as indicators for a diagnosis, but older age (80), lack of an ApoE ε4 allele and less severe cognitive impairment should further inform the differential diagnosis of NFTPD from AD.","tags":null,"title":"ΔSCOPE: A new method to quantify 3D biological structures and identify differences in zebrafish forebrain development","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Honorable Mention National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship | 2020\n 2020, Honorable Mention, National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship 2019, Undergraduate Teaching Award, Caltech Student Committee for Biology Advancement 2018} \u0026amp; \\textbf{Highest Honors}, Smith College Biology Department \\\n\\textsc{2018} \u0026amp; \\textbf{First Place Undergraduate Poster}, New England Society for Developmental Biology \\\n\\textsc{2018} \u0026amp; \\textbf{Finalist}, Rhodes Fellowship\\\n\\textsc{2018} \u0026amp; \\textbf{Finalist}, Marshall Scholarship\\\n\\textsc{2017} \u0026amp; \\textbf{Goldwater Scholar}, Barry Goldwater Scholarship and Excellence in Education Foundation \\\n\\textsc{2017} \u0026amp; \\textbf{Associate Membership}, Sigma Xi, The Scientific Research Honor Society\\\n\\textsc{2017} \u0026amp; \\textbf{First Place Undergraduate Poster}, National Society for Developmental Biology \\\n\\textsc{2016} \u0026amp; \\textbf{First Place Undergraduate Poster}, New England Society for Developmental Biology \\\n\\textsc{2014-2018} \u0026amp; \\textbf{Dean\u0026rsquo;s List}, Smith College \\\n\\textsc{2014-2018} \u0026amp; \\textbf{STRIDE Scholar}, Smith College \\\n\\textsc{2014} \u0026amp; \\textbf{Faculty Prize}, Phoenix Country Day School \\\n\\textsc{2014} \u0026amp; \\textbf{National Merit Scholar}, National Merit Scholarship Program \\  Honorable MentionNational Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship2020   Honorable MentionNational Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship2020 ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"8c8b601c589a5bc57aa679e4f94ae1a0","permalink":"/honors-awards/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/honors-awards/","section":"","summary":"Honorable Mention National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship | 2020\n 2020, Honorable Mention, National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship 2019, Undergraduate Teaching Award, Caltech Student Committee for Biology Advancement 2018} \u0026amp; \\textbf{Highest Honors}, Smith College Biology Department \\","tags":null,"title":"Honors and Awards","type":"page"}]
