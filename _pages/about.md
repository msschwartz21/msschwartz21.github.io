I am passionate about developing [open source software](/software) that puts deep learning models in the hands of biologists at the bench.

As an undergraduate at Smith College working with [Michael Barresi](https://sophia.smith.edu/blog/barresilab/), I studied the formation of commissures in the embryonic zebrafish forebrain. When faced with comparing sets of images from mutant and wildtype zebrafish in order to determine the effect of the mutation, I took an introductory python course and began to develop a method to quantitatively compare mutant and wildtype commissures and obtain a measure of statistical significance for any differences. While presenting my work at developmental biology conferences, I found that others in the field were excited about trying to apply a similar approach to their data. I learned about the best practices for open source software and published my first python package, [$\Delta$SCOPE](https://github.com/msschwartz21/deltascope).

As a graduate student at Caltech, I sought out a lab where I could increase the sophistication of my image analysis methods by incorporating deep learning and ultimately completed my PhD in Biology in the [Van Valen Lab](https://www.vanvalen.caltech.edu/). My thesis work focused on method development both at the bench designing a new approach for optical pooled screens and at the keyboard building deep learning methods for biological image analysis. My experience bridges experimental method design, hands-on data acquisition and downstream analysis with deep learning models. By connecting these three phases, I have found that I can design experiments that are jointly optimized across all three phases. You can learn more about my research [here](/research)

I am excited to pursue the collection of highly multiplexed, multimodal datasets that seek to capture as many axes of cellular state as is experimentally possible. I expect that these datasets while experimentally challenging to collect will enable me to explore the limits of deep learning's biological insight.



I am passionate about developing [open source software](/software) that puts deep learning models in the hands of biologists at the bench.

Early in my career as an undergraduate at Smith College working with [Michael Barresi](https://sophia.smith.edu/blog/barresilab/), I was faced with a challenge: how to quantify and describe the effects of disruptions to cell signaling molecules on the formation of 3D biological structures, called commissures. Each commissure is composed of many neural projections, called axons, each of which makes its own independent decision during its participation in commissure formation, but all are guided by the same signals, giving rise to an ordered structure at the macro-scale, but with significant organism to organism variation. When faced with this challenge, I began looking into ways to develop a computational solution. To this end, I delved into python, approached a professor in statistics, Ben Baumer, who was interested in biology, about collaborating on developing a method to quantify commissure formation, and applied for and received an internship at HHMI's Janelia Research Campus to further advance my computational skill set, working under the guidance of Philip Keller. With these collaborations, I began to develop a method to quantitatively compare mutant and wildtype commissures and obtain a measure of statistical significance for any differences. While presenting my work at developmental biology conferences, I found that others in the field were excited about trying to apply a similar approach to their data. I learned about the best practices for open source software and published my first python package, [$\Delta$SCOPE](https://github.com/msschwartz21/deltascope). As a new scientist, the collaborations and assistance of the community were instrumental in helping me to build this package, and solidified my belief in the value of writing high quality open source software. I found the process of writing my own well-documented code to be a highly rewarding way to give back to the community and resources that made my own work possible, and as I have advanced in my career, I have brought this ethic with me and continue to invest in contributing to packages that serve as community resources.

As a graduate student at Caltech, I continued to pursue my interest in biological image analysis and joined the [Van Valen Lab](https://www.vanvalen.caltech.edu/). In many light microscopy experiments that involve populations of cells, there is a critical analysis step in which each cell must be identified and described with phenotypic metrics. As a member of the Van Valen Lab, I contributed to the DeepCell software ecosystem which uses deep learning to extract single cell information from microscopy images. In addition to developing models for live cell segmentation and tracking, I made DeepCell more accessible to biologists with limited computational expertise. This effort included writing extensive documentation, developing a common application class that wraps around any DeepCell model and turns the process of retrieving segmentation masks into a single predict call, and contributing to DeepCell's cloud deployment which provides drag-and-drop access to model predictions. Along the way, I was involved in assembling and annotating several training datasets where I developed internal infrastructure that enables the lab to version each piece of annotated data along with essential experimental metadata. My infrastructure automates the routine tasks of building annotated datasets and has allowed the lab to rapidly develop datasets for new deep learning tasks as the emerge.

At the bench, my experiments rely on light microscopy which has the advantage of being non-destructive and allowing for repeated rounds of staining and imaging in order to capture different types of information about the cell. To complement this approach, I began to develop a new method for optical pooled screens that generated a visible pattern in the cell which could be visualized in a single round of imaging and used to uniquely identify each cell.
