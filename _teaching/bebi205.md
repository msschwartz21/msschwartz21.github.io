description: As co-developer of Bi 205, I worked alongside Professor Van Valen to develop novel curriculum to capture the massive changes that have happened in the machine learning space. I specifically focused on distilling the key deep learning techniques and advancements into teachable modules, and then developing interactive lessons, contained within Jupyter Notebooks, covering topics ranging from single cell segmentation to cell tracking.
