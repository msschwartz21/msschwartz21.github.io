description: As head TA I successfully coordinated the schedules and assignment of duties to junior TAs, while managing shifting time tables for the curriculum. By creating consistency and setting achievable goals for both students and TAs while managing the expectations of the instructors, we were able to create an engaging and productive learning environment for students, for which I was awarded an Undergraduate Teaching Award by the Caltech Student Committee for Biology Advancement.
