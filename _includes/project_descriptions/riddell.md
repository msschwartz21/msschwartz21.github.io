The Northampton State Hospital was founded in 1856 as a refuge for the mentally ill. Until the hospital closed in 1993, it treated 64,500 patients. More recently, the majority of the hospital's buildings have been taken down and replaced with a new residential neighborhood, Village Hill. I studied the Northampton State Hospital in a First Year Seminar focused on memorializing the history of the hospital. For my final project, I led a group of students in designing a walking tour of the Village Hill neighborhood that would highlight the remaining historical buildings and educate residents and visitors on the history of the property. In the semester following the course, I continued developing markers for the walking tour. The Northampton Historical Society has adopted my proposal in their plan for memorializing Village Hill.
