Neurofibrillary Tangle Predominant Dementia (NFTPD) is a form of dementia characterized by present neurofibrillary tangles and absent amyloid plaques. NFTPD is frequently misdiagnosed as Alzheimerâ€™s Disease (AD) and can only be diagnosed postmortem using brain pathology. The goal of this project was to examine eight NFTPD cases to identify distinguishing clinical features of the dementia. As first author of the paper, I reexamined previously collected data and wrote the paper. When compared to AD cases, NFTPD cases were found to have a later onset of symptoms, an older age at death, and less impairment prior to death. Although NFTPD patients have a different demographic presentation compared to AD patients, both groups present with similar non-cognitive clinical features (delusions, depression, parkinsonism, and hallucinations) that are not an indicator for a diagnosis. In future work, an examination of neuropsychological testing may reveal factors that differentiate NFTPD from AD.
