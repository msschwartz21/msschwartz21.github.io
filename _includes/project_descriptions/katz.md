Microbial populations in tide pools are an understudied source of biodiversity. Tide pools are dynamic environments where microbes, in particular ciliates, are influenced by the changing tide. I compared ciliate biodiversity in eight tide pools from Connecticut and Maine. I hypothesized that each pool would have a unique ciliate population with some common species shared among all pools. To evaluate ciliate biodiversity, I used PCR to amplify ciliate DNA and used denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) to identify unique ciliate species. After sequencing DNA isolated in the DGGE, I identified that CT tide pools were more diverse than ME with at least one unique ciliate per pool while ME tide pools had homogenous populations. In both cases, the ocean ciliate population differed from the tide pool populations. My work on this project contributed to a baseline measurement of ciliate populations in tide pools, which will be used to track the influence of climate change on ciliates.
