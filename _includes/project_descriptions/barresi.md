The field of biology typically relies on qualitative observation to assess changes documented in microscopy images of biological samples. Unfortunately, this methodology lacks rigor and the sensitivity needed to detect subtle changes. In the Barresi lab, we study commissures, which form connections between two hemispheres of the brain. I am developing a computational methodology to take three dimensional images of zebrafish commissures and detect differences between samples. One of the first challenges in this process is to align the commissures of different samples that may have different sized brains or variation in shape. Once we have aligned all of the samples of interest, we are exploring statistical methods to detect deviations from typical commissure structure. Our statistical evaluation relies on calculating a mathematical model of the commissure and evaluating the distribution of points in relationship to the model of the commissure. This approach allows us to take advantage of common statistical methodology used to describe distributions. The code for this project is being developed in Python with the goal of developing a product that will be accessible to the general biology community without assuming prior coding experience.
