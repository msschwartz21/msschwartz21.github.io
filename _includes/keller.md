Brain development is a complex process that involves coordinating the specification of cell type and movement of cells from a starting location in the embryo into the final structure of the brain. In fruit flies, we know that cells that form the brain originate in one particular area of the embryo, but we do not know how they reach their final position in the brain and how they behave as they move there. During my summer at Janelia Research Campus, I developed the first single cell continous fate map for brain development. I worked with time lapse live imaging data of a single embryo collected on the Keller Lab's <a href="http://www.nature.com/nprot/journal/v10/n11/abs/nprot.2015.111.html">SiMView Light Sheet Microscope</a> . I then tracked cells in the brain from their final position in the brain backwards over 19 hours of imaging to their starting point in the embryo using <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwiz5ZKzv__TAhUN-2MKHclHBIwQFggmMAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fimagej.net%2FMaMuT&usg=AFQjCNHLPNxeV8FlnAiDsLy8tbbL3xKynA&sig2=P_GV0tki-1q6kdiao4mwOw">MaMuT</a>. With this approach, I was able to generate the complete three dimensional movement for over 20 brain cells. In Python, I explored this data and developed methods for identifying behavioral trends in 3D cell movement. I found that the relative spatial relationships of neural precursers are preserved in the transition from early embryo to embryonic brain.
