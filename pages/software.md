    <h1>Software</h1>

    As a member of the Van Valen Lab, I contributed to the DeepCell software ecosystem which uses deep learning to extract single cell information from microscopy images. In addition to developing models for live cell segmentation and tracking, I made DeepCell more accessible to biologists with limited computational expertise. This effort included writing extensive documentation, developing a common application class that wraps around any DeepCell model and turns the process of retrieving segmentation masks into a single predict call, and contributing to DeepCell's cloud deployment which provides drag-and-drop access to model predictions. Along the way, I was involved in assembling and annotating several training datasets where I developed internal infrastructure that enables the lab to version each piece of annotated data along with essential experimental metadata. My infrastructure automates the routine tasks of building annotated datasets and has allowed the lab to rapidly develop datasets for new deep learning tasks as they emerge.
